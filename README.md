# Responsive Design Spike

My introduction to responsive front end design which proved to be a very formative learning experience.

## CSS

Researched and implemented
- media rule for conditional widths
- cover image settings
- text transform and text decoration
- custom fonts and font importing
- sticky headers
- dynamic column settings

## For future development

Will look into
- user uploaded images
- draggable divs
- 'wish list'
- collection edits and updates
- funko pop api
